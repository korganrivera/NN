# snn

An example of a generic stochastic neural network.

## Description

The network trains itself on some data before making some predictions. The data is a list of heights and weights that correlate with gender of the person. The network then predicts gender based on given heights and weights. This is just the example data that comes with this. You can use whatever data you want.

### generic

The numbers of layers in the network are modifiable. You can also set as many or as few neurons in each layer as you want.
