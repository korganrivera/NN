==2783== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==2783== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,

==2783==   /usr/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=2783 ...command...
==2783== 
==2783== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==2783==   /path/to/gdb ./nn2
==2783== and then give GDB the following command
==2783==   target remote | /usr/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=2783
==2783== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
